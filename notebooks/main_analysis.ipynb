    "## 2A. Data Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "The Africa-wide dataset used in this assignment was derived from the UN DESA population and health indicators. Data cleaning focused on ensuring completeness, correctness, and internal consistency before moving to supervised modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Missing Values\n",
    "\n",
    "Only one variable contained missing data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `maternal_mortality_ratio_deaths_per_100000_population`, with roughly 25% missing values, all from the year 2024. A verification against the original long-format UN dataset confirmed that these entries were not reported at all for this year. This establishes a pattern of **systematic non-reporting**, not random missingness or cleaning errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because these missing values reflect genuine absence of data, we:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Did not impute maternal mortality values.\n",
    "- Did not drop the corresponding rows.\n",
    "- Restricted models involving maternal mortality to the years with complete data.\n",
    "\n",
    "All other indicators (fertility, under-five mortality, life expectancy, population growth) had no missing values, so no imputation was necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Addressing Outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains real demographic extremes such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Very high fertility rates (≥7)\n",
    "- Elevated under-five mortality (>150 per 1,000)\n",
    "- High maternal mortality (>1,000 per 100,000)\n",
    "\n",
    "These values originate from countries with documented health challenges and are **true characteristics** of African demographic variation, not anomalies. Therefore, we adopted a retention-based strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Outliers were left unchanged.\n",
    "- No capping, clipping, or transformations were applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures fidelity to real-world population health patterns and avoids masking meaningful disparities across the continent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ensuring Data Quality and Consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "To guarantee dataset integrity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All numeric columns were cast to appropriate numeric types.\n",
    "- Region and country names were standardized by trimming whitespace.\n",
    "- Column names were normalized to lowercase with underscores for modeling compatibility.\n",
    "- Dataset structure was validated to ensure **one unique record per country–year pair**.\n",
    "\n",
    "After these checks, the dataset was confirmed clean, consistent, and ready for feature engineering.\n"

    "## 2B. Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature engineering was performed to enhance the dataset’s predictive value and support the supervised learning tasks outlined in this assignment. The engineered features were selected based on domain knowledge, EDA insights, and their relevance to the hypotheses being tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fertility Category (High vs. Low)\n",
    "\n",
    "To operationalize Hypothesis 3 (“Can under-five mortality classify countries into high vs. low fertility?”), we created a categorical feature:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High fertility**: `total_fertility_rate` ≥ 4  \n",
    "- **Low fertility**: `total_fertility_rate` < 4\n",
    "\n",
    "This threshold follows demographic transition literature, where countries with fertility ≥ 4 are typically considered to be in earlier stages of transition. This feature converts a continuous indicator into a label suitable for classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trend Features (2010–2024)\n",
    "\n",
    "To capture demographic progress over time rather than relying solely on static values, we introduced several trend-based features computed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Change 2010–2024 = Value_2024 - Value_2010\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Trend features were created for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Life expectancy (both sexes) change (2010–2024)  \n",
    "- Total fertility rate change (2010–2024)  \n",
    "- Under-five mortality rate change (2010–2024)  \n",
    "- Population growth rate change (2010–2024)  \n",
    "\n",
    "These features represent the trajectory of each country’s demographic shift and provide valuable signals for regression models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Country-Level Mean Indicator Features\n",
    "\n",
    "To capture long-term demographic levels rather than single-year snapshots, we computed the mean of each key indicator for every country across all available years (2010–2024). The following averages were created:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mean life expectancy (both sexes)  \n",
    "- Mean total fertility rate  \n",
    "- Mean under-five mortality  \n",
    "- Mean population growth rate  \n",
    "\n",
    "These aggregated metrics help smooth short-term fluctuations and improve model stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scaling and Normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "For algorithms sensitive to variable scales (e.g., linear models, logistic regression), we applied **standardization** to numeric features during model training. This ensures that all features contribute proportionately to the objective function and prevents scale-driven bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Normalization was **not applied** to the raw dataset itself to preserve interpretability; instead, scaling occurs only within the modeling pipeline to avoid data leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The engineered features improve the dataset’s predictive capacity by combining:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A classification label (**fertility category**)  \n",
    "- Temporal dynamics (**2010–2024 trends**)  \n",
    "- Aggregated demographic summaries (**country-level means**)  \n",
    "- Scale-adjusted versions of numeric predictors during model training  \n",
    "\n",
    "These enhancements directly support the supervised machine learning tasks defined in the assignment and align with best practices in demographic modeling.\n"
