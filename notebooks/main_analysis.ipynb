    "## 2A. Data Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "The Africa-wide dataset used in this assignment was derived from the UN DESA population and health indicators. Data cleaning focused on ensuring completeness, correctness, and internal consistency before moving to supervised modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Missing Values\n",
    "\n",
    "Only one variable contained missing data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `maternal_mortality_ratio_deaths_per_100000_population`, with roughly 25% missing values, all from the year 2024. A verification against the original long-format UN dataset confirmed that these entries were not reported at all for this year. This establishes a pattern of **systematic non-reporting**, not random missingness or cleaning errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because these missing values reflect genuine absence of data, we:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Did not impute maternal mortality values.\n",
    "- Did not drop the corresponding rows.\n",
    "- Restricted models involving maternal mortality to the years with complete data.\n",
    "\n",
    "All other indicators (fertility, under-five mortality, life expectancy, population growth) had no missing values, so no imputation was necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Addressing Outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains real demographic extremes such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Very high fertility rates (≥7)\n",
    "- Elevated under-five mortality (>150 per 1,000)\n",
    "- High maternal mortality (>1,000 per 100,000)\n",
    "\n",
    "These values originate from countries with documented health challenges and are **true characteristics** of African demographic variation, not anomalies. Therefore, we adopted a retention-based strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Outliers were left unchanged.\n",
    "- No capping, clipping, or transformations were applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures fidelity to real-world population health patterns and avoids masking meaningful disparities across the continent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ensuring Data Quality and Consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "To guarantee dataset integrity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All numeric columns were cast to appropriate numeric types.\n",
    "- Region and country names were standardized by trimming whitespace.\n",
    "- Column names were normalized to lowercase with underscores for modeling compatibility.\n",
    "- Dataset structure was validated to ensure **one unique record per country–year pair**.\n",
    "\n",
    "After these checks, the dataset was confirmed clean, consistent, and ready for feature engineering.\n"

    "Feature engineering was applied to enrich the dataset with additional information that improves predictive performance and provides deeper analytical insight into demographic transitions across African countries. All engineered features were derived from domain knowledge, prior EDA findings, and the goals of the hypotheses being tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trend Features (2010–2024)\n",
    "\n",
    "To capture the *direction and magnitude* of demographic change over time, we computed trend-based features representing the difference between each country’s earliest and latest available values:\n",

    "\\[\n",
    "Change_2010–2024 = Value_2024 - Value_2010\n",
    "\\]\n",

    "Trend features were generated for four core indicators:\n",

    "- Life expectancy (both sexes)\n",
    "- Total fertility rate\n",
    "- Under-five mortality rate\n",
    "- Population growth rate\n",
    "\n",
    "These engineered features quantify how far each country has progressed over the study period and allow the models to learn *trajectories*, not just static snapshots. They are especially relevant given Africa’s ongoing demographic transition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Country-Level Mean Indicator Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Short-term fluctuations in demographic indicators can obscure broader patterns. To incorporate structural characteristics of each country, we generated mean-level aggregates across all available years (2010–2024):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mean life expectancy (both sexes)\n",
    "- Mean total fertility rate\n",
    "- Mean under-five mortality rate\n",
    "- Mean population growth rate\n",

    "\n",
    "### Scaling (Performed in the Modeling Pipeline)\n",
    "\n",
    "Certain machine learning algorithms—particularly linear models—are sensitive to differences in feature scale. To address this, numeric features were standardized *after* the train-test split to prevent data leakage:\n",

    "- **4 mean features** summarizing long-term national characteristics  \n",
